    <b>At the end of 2nd Quarter,</b> I have learnt more about CASCADING STYLE SHEETS or CSS. CSS made my<br>
    website more advanced and pairs well with html. Although, 2nd Quarter is most likely just the<br>
    introduction of CSS and we will learn more about it in 3rd Quarter. Even though that there are<br>
    several properties and values in HTML and CSS, you will be used to it and you don't have to<br>
    memorize every single code but familiarize yourself with it. A website that could be used to<br>
    help you is <a href="W3schools.com">W3schools.com.</a> This website contains every tutorials and<br>
    guides that you will be using in coding. Most likely as we progress in ICT subject, we will also be<br>
    learning about Javascript or scripting languages.
